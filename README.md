Open Source PAPR firmware for the ATMEGA328 platform

Welcome to the Nightly builds page! The following features are being tested:

- Code is partially modularized (Major change!)
- Added Quickcharge 2.0 Module
- Started setup for PID (Feedback) Module, along with switch for determining which mode to use.
- Simplified selection of PWM frequency
- Experimental switch interrupt (Yay multitasking!)
- Various improvements to variables (fixed assignment of float to int and minor optimization of memory use)
- A settings page!
- PID control
- Sensor readings with averaging
